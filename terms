<h2>Security Policy</h2>

<p>The security of financial information is extremely important to us, and we are committed to protecting this information. Card.io never saves card numbers, all data is protected with 256-bit SSL encryption, and our servers are hosted in secure facilities.  We may also employ proprietary security techniques to protect data against fraud, loss, misuse, alteration, and unauthorized access.</p>

<p>Card.io requires all customers that use our service to comply with all applicable laws, including data usage and protection laws that require posting a privacy policy and treating customer data with appropriate care and security. We encourage all users to review the security and privacy policies of sites and apps they visit for information about those sitesâ€™ data practices.</p>

<p>We are committed to immediately addressing any problems should they occur. If you believe you have found a security problem, please contact us at security@card.io with sufficient information to reproduce the problem, and we will respond within 48 hours.</p>

<h2>Privacy Policy</h2>

<p>Our customers may be asked to provide personal information during the registration process, including name, email address, and company information. We use this information only for the purpose for which it is requested, including validation, notification of account information, and to inform you of various company products or services.</p>

<p>This policy also extends to treatment of personal information from end-users of the card.io services, including our card scanning services. When we receive a request to scan a credit card from an authorized application, we may collect a variety of information, including: IP address, timestamp, and a one-way, non-recoverable hash of the phone's unique device identifier. We never save any card numbers or the phone's unhashed unique device identifier.</p>

<p>Customers or users that have any privacy concerns can <a href="/support/">contact support</a>.</p>

<p>Disclaimer. You acknowledge that the Service is still experimental in nature. Company does not represent or warrant that the Service is reliable, accurate, complete, or otherwise free from defects. Accordingly, the Service is made available for use "as is", and any use thereof will be undertaken solely at Your own risk. Company reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to include or cease providing the Service at any time (subject to notice as may be required herein), and Company does not give or enter into any conditions, warranties or other terms with regard to the Service. In particular, no condition, warranty or other term is given or entered into to the effect that the Service will be of satisfactory quality, noninfringement or that the Service will be fit for any particular purpose. For the avoidance of doubt, Company does not guarantee the Service will be operable at all times or during any down time (i) caused by outages to any public Internet backbones, networks or servers, (ii) caused by any failures of Your equipment, systems or local access services, (iii) for previously scheduled maintenance or (iv) relating to events beyond Company's (or its wholly owned subsidiaries') control such as strikes, riots, insurrection, fires, floods, explosions, war, governmental action, labor conditions, earthquakes, natural disasters, or interruptions in Internet services to an area where Company (or its wholly owned subsidiaries) or Your servers are located or co-located.</p>

<p>Limitation of Liability. Company AND ITS WHOLLY OWNED SUBSIDIARIES WILL NOT BE LIABLE TO YOU OR ANY THIRD-PARTY CLAIMANT FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, PUNITIVE, CONSEQUENTIAL (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, LOST PROFITS OR LOST DATA COLLECTED THROUGH THE SERVICE), OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, WHETHER BASED ON A CLAIM OR ACTION OF CONTRACT, WARRANTY, NEGLIGENCE, STRICT LIABILITY, OR OTHER TORT, BREACH OF ANY STATUTORY DUTY, INDEMNITY OR CONTRIBUTION, OR OTHERWISE, EVEN IF Company AND/OR ITS SUBSIDIARIES AND AFFILIATES HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. SOME STATES DO NOT ALLOW THE LIMITATION OR EXCLUSION OF LIABILITY FOR INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THE LIMITATIONS OR EXCLUSIONS IN THIS AND THE FOREGOING PARAGRAPH MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. In any event, Company's (and its wholly owned subsidiaries') total cumulative liability to You or any other party for any loss or damages resulting from any claims, demands, or actions arising out of or relating to this Agreement will not exceed U.S. $500.</p>

<p>Representations and Warranties. You represent and warrant that: (i) You have and will maintain throughout the Service Term all rights, authorizations and licenses (including without limitation any copyright, trademark, patent, publicity or other rights) that are required with respect to Service Data to permit Company to perform the Services contemplated under this Agreement (including without limitation any rights needed to host, cache, route, transmit, store, copy, modify, distribute, perform, display, reformat, excerpt, analyze, and create algorithms from and derivative works of Service Data); (ii) You will not use Service for anything illegal or engage in any illegal or fraudulent business practice; (iii) all of the information provided by You to Company to enroll in the Service is correct and current; (iv) You have all necessary right, power, and authority to enter into this Agreement and to perform the acts required of You hereunder; and (v) You have complied and will continue to comply with all applicable laws, statutes, ordinances, and regulations (including without limitation, any relevant financial, data protection, or privacy laws) in Your performance of any acts hereunder.</p>

You agree to indemnify, defend and hold Company, its agents, affiliates, subsidiaries, directors, officers, employees, and applicable third parties (e.g. relevant advertisers, syndication partners, licensors, licensees, consultants and contractors) (collectively "Indemnified Person(s)") harmless from and against any and all third party claims, liability, loss, and expense (including damage awards, settlement amounts, and reasonable legal fees), brought against any Indemnified Person(s), arising out of, related to or which may arise from Your use of the Service, the Service App(s), and/or Your breach of any term of this Agreement.</p>

<p>Miscellaneous. All claims arising out of or relating to this Agreement will be litigated exclusively in the federal or state courts of San Francisco County, California, USA and Company and You consent to personal jurisdiction in those courts. The Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the Service. Any notices to Company must be sent to: Lumber Labs, Inc., 455 Valencia Avenue, San Francisco, CA 94103 via certified mail or overnight courier, and are deemed given upon receipt. Notice to You may be effected by sending email to the email address specified in Your account, or by posting a message to Your account interface, and is deemed received when sent (for email) or no more than fifteen (15) days after having been posted (for messages in Your Service Interface). Company's waiver of any default is not a waiver of any subsequent default. Unenforceable provisions will be modified to reflect the parties' intention, and remaining provisions of the Agreement will remain in full effect. You may not assign any of Your rights hereunder and any such attempt is void. Company and You are not legal partners or agents, but are independent contractors. All sections will survive any expiration or termination of this Agreement.</p>
